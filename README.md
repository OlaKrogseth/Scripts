# Scripts

# Hello and welcome to the README for some of my frequently used data management, manipulation, reading, and plotting scripts. (and some animations)
#These scripts are designed to automate tasks that are performed regularly, helping me to save time and improve my productivity.

#All are mostly used as:
# Data cleaning scripts
# Data manipulation scripts
# Data reading scripts
# Data plotting scripts

Some of the more comprehensive scripts are well documented. However, other scripts are not documented at all, depending the simplicity of the script.

A zipfile containing animations made in blender is also made available.
